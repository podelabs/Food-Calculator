# Food Calculator
  This app is a simple tool for calculating the weight of food that can be consumed per portion, based on the weight and calorie content of various food items. The app prompts the user to enter the weight and measurement scale for each food item, converts the weight to grams using a dictionary of conversion factors, and stores the weight of each food item in a list. The app then prompts the user to enter the number of portions and, if desired, a calorie restriction per portion. If a calorie restriction is set, the app calculates the total number of calories in all food items, the total number of calories per portion, the maximum weight of food that can be consumed per portion to meet the calorie restriction, and the actual weight of food that can be consumed per portion, accounting for any excess weight. The app then outputs the total weight of all food items and the actual weight of food that can be consumed per portion, along with any additional information that was calculated.
